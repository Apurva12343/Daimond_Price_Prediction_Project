# ðŸ’Ž Diamond Price Prediction Project

This is a **Machine Learning-based web application** designed to predict the price of diamonds based on various attributes such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and other features. The application is built using Python and leverages a trained ML model to provide accurate price predictions through a user-friendly web interface.

Whether you're a data science enthusiast or someone curious about the pricing dynamics of diamonds, this project offers a hands-on implementation of a predictive modeling pipelineâ€”from development to deployment on a local server.

```

### âœ… Step 4: Activate the Virtual Environment
```bash
conda activate venv/
```
or  
```bash
conda activate venv
```

### âœ… Step 5: Install Required Libraries
```bash
python setup.py install
```

### âœ… Step 6: Run the Application

python application.py
```

### âœ… Step 7: Access the Web Interface
Once the server starts, you'll see a **local URL in the logs** (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).

### âœ… Step 8: Navigate to the Prediction Page
Open the URL in your browser and append `/predict` to access the prediction form:
```
http://localhost:5000/predict
```

### âœ… Step 9: Make Predictions
Fill in the diamond's features and submit the form to get the predicted price instantly.
